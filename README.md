# React Native Template

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js > 12](https://nodejs.org) and npm (Recommended: Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman)
- [Xcode 12](https://developer.apple.com/xcode)
- [Cocoapods 1.10.1](https://cocoapods.org)
- [JDK > 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Android Studio and Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Base dependencies

- [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) navigation library.
- [moment](https://momentjs.com/docs/) for date format.
-[react-native-extended-stylesheet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-extended-stylesheet) for responsive styling
- [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)for testing.

## Usage

### Option 1: Using React-Native-Rename

You can start by cloning this repository and using [react-native-rename](https://github.com/junedomingo/react-native-rename). In the current state of this project, it should give you no issues at all, just run the script, delete your node modules and reinstall them and you should be good to go.

Keep in mind that this library can cause trouble if you are renaming a project that uses `Pods` on the iOS side.

After that you should proceed as with any javascript project:

- Go to your project's root folder and run `npm install`.
- If you are using Xcode 12.5 or higher got to /ios and execute `pod install --`repo-update`
- Run `npm run ios` or `npm run android` to start your application!

(Using yarn: `yarn ios` or `yarn android`)

Note: Please read the Setup environments section that is below in this file for more information about the execution scripts.

### Option 2: Copy the structure to your project

If you want to roll on your own and don't want to use this as a template, you can create your project and then copy the `/src` folder (which has all the code of your application) and update your `index.js`.

Keep in mind that if you do this, you'll have to **install and link** all dependencies (as well as adding all the necessary native code for each library that requires it).

## Folder structure

This template follows a very simple project structure:

- `src`: This folder is the main container of all the code inside your application.
  - `assets`: Asset folder to store all images, vectors, etc.
  - `components`: Folder to store any common component that you use through your app (such as a generic button)
  - `constants`: Folder to store any kind of constant that you have.
  - `localization`: Folder to store the languages files.
  - `navigation`: Folder to store the navigators.
  - `screens`: Folder that contains all your application screens/features.
    - `Screen`: Each screen should be stored inside its folder and inside it a file for its code and a separate one for the styles and tests.
      - `Screen.js`
      - `Screen.styles.js`
      - `Screen.test.js`
  - `test-utils`: Folder to store tests-related utilities and components.
  - `theme`: Folder to store all the styling concerns related to the application theme.
  - `App.js`: Main component that starts your whole app.
  - `index.js`: Entry point of your application as per React-Native standards.

## Splash screen customization

To customize the splash screen (logo and background color) use the CLI provided in the [official docs](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-bootsplash#assets-generation).

## Setup environments

### Using scripts from console

The template already has scripts to execute the project calling a specific environment defined into the package.json file. Keep in mind that if you are going to create new `envs` you have to define the script to build the project properly.

To define which env you want to use, just keep the structure `yarn [platform]: [environment]`


DEV: `yarn ios` or `yarn android`

STG: `yarn ios:staging` or `yarn android:staging`

PROD: `yarn ios:prod` o `yarn android:prod`

Also, you can use npm following the same rule as before: `npm run ios:staging`

Modify the environment variables files in root folder (`.env.development`, `.env.production` and `.env.staging`)
